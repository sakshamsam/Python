The Projects I have build are Portfolio Manager (Desktop App), Dictionary (Database App) and Website Blocker (Web App using scripting). Specifically the python applications I have build are :

	1. Dictionary - It is a program that returns English-word Definition along with suggestions for correct search if the input by user contains some spelling error. 
	2. Website Blocker - A scripts that runsa task scheduled at startup of your machine to blocks access to distracting websites for the time interval chosen.
	3. Investment Manager - It is a desktop based graphical executable program made using tkinter with a database backend.
